The intended audience here is a liberal news reader, with the story being more people are being apprehended and being held for longer periods of time.  The first graphic shows the increases in apprehension.  The people icons hopes to engage the audience emotionally.  Red icons for children make it much more obvious of the increase as you move between tabs as well as stresses their importance.  Yellow icons for families also help stress their importance, and makes it very clear that their group drastically increased.  Single adults are grey out to lessen their importance, they are not the main attraction for this particular story.  The second graphic shows just how many people are being held for an unacceptable amount of time.  By using donut charts, the large percentage of people being held for 72 hours or more than 10 days are brought to the forefront, with assistance from strong colors.  

#### For Inclusion in the Report
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="45f99a97-101c-4c1b-9289-809020936d69" data-type="interactive" data-title="Infographic for DHS Report"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>

The intended audience here is policymakers, with the story being CBP and ICE require more funding if you want the harrowing stories of overcrowding to stop being played on the news.  The first graphic summarizes the problem, the increase of illegal immigrants being apprehended at the border.  The bar charts were used so there could be an easy comparison between last year and this year, and makes it clear that each category has increased, but families was clearly the most.  The second graphic summarizes what is usually be stated in the news: that an unacceptable amount of people are being held longer than the standard amount and some for far longer, and that no small amount of these people are children.  The stacked bar charts shows that for each category, children take a fairly sizable chunk of the detainees.  The third graphic summarizes why the second graphic is happening, because ICE also is being overwhelmed, so they can't take the people away from CBP.  The half-donut, particularly the red, shows how there is a rather large gap of funding that ICE needs to do its job properly and help alliviate the overcrowding issues.

#### Comparing the two infographics
Comparing the two infographics, it was interesting to see that while the data remained the same, the presentation of them were different.  The report to DHS was very matter of fact, using bar graphs to get the point across, while the news story used other forms of visualization to editorialize the story.  In addition, the news story did not talk about the last section, which focused on funding, as this is A) something that runs counter to the narrative the other two sections are trying to provide and B) not something the readers could directly affect.
