# Telling-Stories-with-Data-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class
# About Me
My name is Harley Chang, pronouns "he/him."  I'm a graduate student in the Masters of Educational Technologies and Applied Learning Sciences, or METALS for short.  I've been a high school math teacher for the past 5 years and I'm hoping to transition into a project/product manager role at an educational technology company after I graduate.
# What I Hope to Learn
As a project/product manager, communication is crucial.  Good data visualization will most certainly be a big part of communicating results to stakeholders or administrators in a clear and succinct way.  I want to learn how to organize multi-dimensional data in a way that can be easy to understand, as well as be able to use it in a way to help convince my audience of whatever argument I'm trying to make.
