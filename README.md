# Telling-Stories-with-Data-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class
# About Me
My name is Harley Chang, pronouns "he/him."  I'm a graduate student in the Masters of Educational Technologies and Applied Learning Sciences, or METALS for short.  I've been a high school math teacher for the past 5 years and I'm hoping to transition into a project/product manager role at an educational technology company after I graduate.
# What I Hope to Learn
As a project/product manager, communication is crucial.  Good data visualization will most certainly be a big part of communicating results to stakeholders or administrators in a clear and succinct way.  I want to learn how to organize multi-dimensional data in a way that can be easy to understand, as well as be able to use it in a way to help convince my audience of whatever argument I'm trying to make.

<iframe title="In 2020 Democratic Fund-Raising, Five Candidates Stand Out" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-jZJQn" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jZJQn/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="585"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

Although Aestetics have certainly decreased by changing the visualization into a simple bar graph, it's much clearer now exactly who is first, second, etc.  At the same time, the point that there are 5 clear front runners in terms of fundraising has not been lost.  In addition, all of the people under the top 5 now have some say in the visualization, instead of being essentially ignored and impossible to compare.  I did take one last liberty of cutting off everyone who didn't make the 1 million dollar mark.  The story accompanying the graphic speaks of how important money is to having a successful and lasting campaign.  Those who can't even reach the 1 million mark will very likely never make it to the end anyway, thus I didn't include them.

The intended audience here is policymakers, with the story being CBP and ICE require more funding if you want the harrowing stories of overcrowding to stop being played on the news.  The first graphic summarizes the problem, the increase of illegal immigrants being apprehended at the border.  The second graphic summarizes
