# Project Proposal

## High Level Summary

My program, the Master’s in Educational Technologies and Applied Learning Sciences (or METALS for short) prides itself on being one of the few places at CMU dedicated to the study of education.  Common sense dictates that education professors are generally better at teaching than those who have not dedicated their life to learning this field.  However, METALS professors are also not education professors, but rather those who have simply made education their area of study.  It will be interesting to see if METALS professors also can fit the bill of being generally better at teaching than their general HCI colleagues.  

## Story Structure

Setup: Metals currently advertises 100% career placement and what do people do

Conflict: This tells very little about what the program experience itself is like

Resolution: METALS should also advertise the excellence in teaching their professors give

User Stories: 

1. As a reader I want to come to METALS, so that I can learn from all these great teachers

2. As a reader I want to know what classes are the highest/lowest rated, so I can take/avoid those classes

## Initial sketches


## The data

The data comes from the faculty evaluation database that stores all the faculty evaluations from across CMU’s many different schools since 2008.  It can be found at this website: https://wwwh3.smartevals.com/reporting/StudentsSeeResults.aspx.  The specific data I’m using is a cleaned up, filtered version of this very large dataset that includes only courses from the HCI department and only courses 2015 onwards due to a different system of tracking how many hours were spent on the course before 2015.  As METALS’ first year was in 2013, the loss of data is minimal due to the previous problem.  The specific variables I’ll potentially use from the evaluation are year the course was taught, course ID, professor teaching the course, response rate, number of hours per week needed for class, and overall teaching rating.  Variables thrown out include section number and all the specific rating questions.  These are all too detailed and will likely have little information gain for the reader compared to the trouble it will be to comprehend the extra information.

## Method and medium

The story will be delivered via an infographic made through shorthand.
